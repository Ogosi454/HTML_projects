        <h2>The life history of Sir Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
        <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a prominent computer scientist best known as the <strong>Inventor of the World Wide Web.</strong></p>
        <p>He was born in London - 1995, and graduated from the <b>University of Oxford with a degree in physics in <time>1976.</time></b> While working as a software engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics labaratory in Geneva, he drew up a proposal in <time>1989</time>for a global hypertext document system to help researchers share information efficiently.</p>
        <p>Between <time>1990</time>and <time>1991</time>, he wrote the software for the first web server and the first web client, or browser. Crucially he decided to make the underlying code and protocols (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, and <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>) available on a royalty-free basis, which allowed the web to grow expotentially without central control.</p>
        <p>In <time>1994</time>, Berners-Lee founded the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> at the <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong> to develop open standards for the Web's continued growth and ensure it works well for everyone. His contributions have earned him numerous honors, including a <mark>knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2004</mark> and the <mark>prestigious ACM Turing Award</mark> often referred as the <mark><q>Nobel Price of computing</q>, in 2016.</mark> He remains a vocal advocate for digital equality and user control over data.</p>
